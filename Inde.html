          Mariana is the owner and the lead designer of Mangata and Gallo. After
          graduating from design school with a specialization in diamond cutting
          and metal smithing, Mariana opened a store in her hometown, Austin and
          started to grow her business online. Mariana has always managed every
          aspect of the business, from jewelry design to marketing to
          e-commerce. However, she recently hired several artisans to help craft
          her designs and a young employee to help manage the company website
          and social media accounts.
